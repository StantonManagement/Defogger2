# Design Guidelines for Developer Task Management System

## Design Approach
**Selected Approach**: Reference-Based (Linear/GitHub Projects)
**Justification**: Professional productivity tool requiring clean data visualization and efficient task management workflows. Linear's design excellence in developer tools provides the perfect foundation for task flow management.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Light Mode:**
- Primary: 220 85% 60% (Linear-inspired blue)
- Secondary: 220 12% 96% (subtle gray surfaces)
- Accent: 260 85% 65% (purple for priority indicators)
- Surface: 0 0% 100% (white backgrounds)
- Border: 220 8% 92% (subtle dividers)

**Dark Mode:**
- Primary: 220 85% 70% (brighter blue for contrast)
- Secondary: 220 15% 12% (dark surfaces)
- Accent: 260 80% 75% (softer purple)
- Surface: 220 10% 8% (dark background)
- Border: 220 15% 18% (dark borders)

### B. Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Headings**: 600 weight, precise hierarchy (text-2xl, text-xl, text-lg)
- **Body**: 400 weight, 14px base for data density
- **Code/Labels**: 500 weight, monospace for task IDs

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Units**: Tailwind units of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8
- Dense layouts: p-4 for cards, p-2 for table cells
- Section spacing: gap-6 between major sections
- Consistent 16px (space-4) rhythm throughout

### D. Component Library

**Dashboard Cards**
- Minimal border design with subtle shadows
- Icon + metric + trend visualization
- Rounded corners (rounded-lg) with clean typography

**Task Table**
- Compact row height for data density
- Status indicators with color coding
- Sortable headers with subtle hover states
- Priority badges with accent colors

**Team Workload Charts**
- Horizontal bar charts for capacity visualization
- Avatar + name + progress bar layout
- Subtle background fills for load indicators

**Navigation Sidebar**
- Collapsed/expanded states
- Icon-first design with clear labels
- Active state indicators with primary color

**Decision Workflow Cards**
- Card-based approval system
- Clear action buttons (approve/reject)
- Progress indicators for workflow stages

**Settings Panels**
- Grouped form sections with clear dividers
- Toggle switches and input fields
- Consistent spacing and alignment

### E. Page Structure

**Main Layout:**
1. **Sidebar Navigation**: Collapsible with icons and labels
2. **Top Bar**: Breadcrumbs, search, and user profile
3. **Content Area**: Dashboard grid or table views
4. **Modals/Overlays**: Task details and creation forms

**Dashboard Grid**: 3-column responsive layout for stats cards
**Table Views**: Full-width with sticky headers and pagination
**Detail Views**: Modal overlays with comprehensive task information

### F. Interaction Patterns
- **Hover States**: Subtle elevation and color shifts
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens for data-heavy views
- **Empty States**: Helpful illustrations with clear actions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly with adaptive layouts

### G. Visual Hierarchy
- High contrast for critical information (task status, priorities)
- Subtle backgrounds for grouping related content
- Consistent iconography throughout the interface
- Clear visual distinction between different data types

**Key Design Principle**: Information density balanced with visual clarity - maximizing productivity while maintaining Linear's signature clean aesthetic for professional developer workflows.

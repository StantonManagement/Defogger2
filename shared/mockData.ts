## Overview
This system manages the flow from ideas to GitHub issues through a structured workflow.

### Process Steps
1. **Ideas** â†’ INBOX folder
2. **Review & Format** â†’ READY_TO_ASSIGN folder  
3. **Assignment** â†’ GitHub Issues
4. **Completion** â†’ ARCHIVE folder

## Getting Started
- Check INBOX daily for new ideas
- Format tasks using the template
- Assign priority levels
- Push to GitHub when ready

### Priority Levels
- ðŸ”´ **High**: Critical bugs, security issues
- ðŸŸ¡ **Medium**: Feature requests, improvements
- ðŸŸ¢ **Low**: Nice-to-have, documentation

## Templates
Use the standard task template for consistency.`,

  FULL_WORKFLOW: `# Complete Workflow Documentation

## Detailed Process

### 1. INBOX Processing
Raw ideas and conversations get dumped here. Review daily to:
- Extract actionable tasks
- Eliminate duplicates
- Group related items

### 2. Task Formatting
Convert INBOX items to structured tasks:

\`\`\`markdown
# Task: [Clear Title]

**For:** [Developer Name]  
**Days:** [Estimated time]  
**Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]

## What needs to be built
[Clear description of requirements]

## Success looks like
- [ ] Specific criteria 1
- [ ] Specific criteria 2
- [ ] Specific criteria 3

## Technical notes
[Implementation details, constraints, dependencies]
\`\`\`

### 3. GitHub Integration
- Create issues from READY tasks
- Include all task details
- Assign to appropriate developer
- Add priority labels

### 4. Tracking Progress
- Monitor GitHub issues
- Update task status
- Move completed work to ARCHIVE

## Best Practices
1. Keep task descriptions clear and actionable
2. Include all necessary context
3. Set realistic time estimates
4. Review priority regularly`,

From conversation with team about improving auth flow.

## Key Points
- Current token system is manual
- Need GitHub OAuth for multiple users
- Session management needed
- Logout functionality missing

## Rough Ideas
- Implement OAuth flow
- Store tokens securely
- Session persistence
- User profile display`,

Notes from user feedback session.

## Feedback
- Dashboard feels empty
- Need better visual hierarchy
- Task cards too plain
- Missing workflow visualization

## Ideas
- Add workflow diagram
- Improve card design
- Better color coding
- Visual progress indicators`,

**For:** Christian Sumoba  
**Days:** 3  
**Priority:** High

## What needs to be built
Update the authentication system to use GitHub OAuth instead of personal access tokens. This will allow multiple users to log in with their GitHub accounts.

## Success looks like
- [ ] Users can click "Login with GitHub" button
- [ ] OAuth flow completes successfully  
- [ ] User info displayed in dashboard
- [ ] Sessions persist across refreshes
- [ ] Logout functionality works

## Technical notes
- Use existing OAuth implementation as reference
- Store tokens securely in sessions
- Implement refresh token logic
- Handle edge cases (expired tokens, network errors)

## Dependencies
- GitHub OAuth App credentials
- Session storage setup`,

Create a complete UI/UX design mockup for a Developer Task Management System.

CORE PURPOSE:
Interface for managing the flow of tasks from ideas → decisions → developer assignments → GitHub issues.

DESIGN THESE PAGES:

1. DASHBOARD (Home)
- Stats cards: Ready Tasks (number), Assigned Tasks (number), Pending Decisions (number), Team Capacity (visual indicator)
- Activity feed: Last 5 actions (e.g., "Task pushed to Kurt", "Decision approved")
- Quick action buttons: Review Tasks, Check Workload, Pending Decisions
- System health: OneDrive ✓ GitHub ✓ (connection status indicators)

2. READY TASKS
- Table with columns: Task Title | Priority | Est. Days | Target Dev | Actions
- Each row has: View Details button, Push to GitHub button
- Filter bar: By priority, by component, by estimated time
- Bulk select checkboxes for archiving
- Search box at top

3. TEAM WORKLOAD
- Developer cards showing:
  * Name and profile pic
  * Current load: 3/5 tasks (progress bar)
  * Color indicator (green/yellow/red based on load)
  * Expandable list of their current tasks
- Summary bar: Total tasks: 15 | Avg per dev: 3 | Available capacity: 8 tasks
- "Suggest Assignment" smart helper

4. DECISIONS
- Two tabs: Pending | History
- Pending shows cards with:
  * Title, cost, time estimate
  * Business case preview
  * Approve/Reject buttons
- History shows table with date, decision, status badge

5. PUSH TASK MODAL (overlay)
- Shows when clicking "Push to GitHub"
- Fields: Issue title, Assignee dropdown, Labels, Priority
- Preview of how issue will look
- Warning if assignee is overloaded
- Confirm/Cancel buttons

6. SETTINGS
- Three tabs: API Configuration | System | Help
- API tab has sections for:
  * OneDrive credentials (with test button)
  * GitHub credentials (with test button)
  * Save changes button
- Show/hide password toggles for sensitive fields

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, professional appearance
- Dark mode option toggle in header
- Responsive layout (desktop priority, mobile friendly)
- Color scheme: Blues/grays for professional feel
- Status colors: Green (good), Yellow (warning), Red (alert)
- Sans-serif font (Inter or similar)
- Subtle shadows for depth
- Toast notifications area (bottom right)

NAVIGATION:
Fixed sidebar with: Dashboard, Ready Tasks, Team Workload, Decisions, Settings
Header with: Current repo "Defogger2", user profile, dark mode toggle

Make it feel like a proper project management tool - clean like Linear or GitHub Projects, not cluttered.

markdown# Add Payment Tracking to Defogger2

## Current State
The task management app is working but needs payment tracking features added and dummy data removed.

## Required Changes

### 1. Remove ALL Dummy Data
Replace everywhere:
- "John Developer" â†’ "Alex Korallus-Shapiro"  
- "Jane Smith", "John Doe" â†’ Remove completely
- "test_project" â†’ "collections_poc" (These are component POCs, not tests)

### 2. Add Payment Tracking System

#### Database Schema
Add new tables/collections:
```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  developer_name VARCHAR(100),
  component VARCHAR(100),
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  payment_status ENUM('pending', 'paid', 'partial'),
  payment_date TIMESTAMP,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE developer_ledger (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  developer_name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  total_earned DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
  total_paid DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
  balance_due DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
  last_payment_date TIMESTAMP,
  payment_method VARCHAR(50) -- 'paypal', 'crypto', 'bank'
);
New UI Components

Payment Status Column in task list:

ðŸ”´ Unpaid (red)
ðŸŸ¡ Partial (yellow)
ðŸŸ¢ Paid (green)

Developer Ledger Page (/ledger):

   Developer     | Component        | Amount | Status  | Actions
   --------------|------------------|--------|---------|----------
   Jose          | Task Queue       | $75    | Pending | [Mark Paid]
   Christian     | Event Bus        | $75    | Pending | [Mark Paid]
   Cedrick       | Notifications    | $75    | Pending | [Mark Paid]
   Gabriel       | Doc Processing   | $75    | Pending | [Mark Paid]
   
   Total Outstanding: $300

Payment Modal when clicking [Mark Paid]:

Date picker for payment date
Amount field (pre-filled, editable for partial)
Payment method dropdown
Notes field
[Confirm Payment] button



3. Correct Developer List
Use ONLY these developers (remove all others):

Paul Limbo (API Framework)
Jose Enrico Maxino (Task Queue)
Christian Sumoba (Event Bus)
Cedrick Barzaga (Notification Service)
Gabriel Jerdhy Lapuz (Document Processing)
Kurt (SMS Agent)

4. Component Tracking
Each task should track:

project: "collections_system"
component: "task_queue" | "event_bus" | "notifications" | "documents" | "api_framework" | "sms_agent"
phase: "poc" | "mvp" | "production"

5. Add Manual Override
Since this is POC phase, add ability to:

Manually mark payment status
Edit amounts
Add payment notes
Export ledger as CSV

Keep These Working

GitHub OAuth login
Task creation to GitHub issues
Existing dashboard layout
File reading from TaskManagement folder

Test with Real Data
Create test entries for the actual developers and components listed above, not dummy data.
